            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS We have been lately informed of an Order pretended to be made in the House of Commons, wherein the Loyall and dutifull carriage of Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> to Vs, and in obedience to Our just commands, in Our Counties of <hi>Cornewall</hi> and <hi>Devon,</hi> is much inveighed against, and stiled to be Hostile and Rebellious, and upon the complaint of one <hi>William Strode</hi> (a Person whom We have accused, and is notoriously known to be guilty of High Treason, and endeavouring to take away Our Life from Vs) the Estate of the said Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> is by that Order, without the least colour of Iustice or pretence of Legall power, sequestred into the hands of the said <hi>Strode;</hi> We have thought Our selfe obliged in Honour and Iustice to Our selfe, the said Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> and such other Loyall and dutifull Persons who joyne with him in Our Service to declare, that the House of Commons, hath not the least power to sequester or dispose of the Estates of any of Our Subjects, or can usurpe the same, without destroying the interest and Property they were borne to; And to publish to all Our good Subjects, that the said Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> with other Persons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Quality being long since imployed in a Peaceable manner, and according to the known Lawes of the Land, to preserve the Peace of Our County of <hi>Somerset,</hi> then endangered by the Faction and Sedition of some turbulent Persons there, where the said Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> and his Ancestors had long lived with great Reputation; and to oppose that illegall and grievous imposition of the <hi>Militia</hi> upon Our good Subjects of that County, that the Lord Marquesse <hi>Hartford,</hi> and all the considerable Gentry of that Our County being there together in their own Country, where there Estates lay, and where they had alwaies lived, were by force and violence of a Rebellious Army assaulted and driven from their own Houses, insomuch as We were compelled to send Our Commission to the said Lord Marquesse under Our Great seale of England, to be Our Generall, and to raise Forces to resist and subdue that desperate Rebellion, which neverthelesse got so great a head, by the Malice and Industry of ill Instruments, infuseing into the mindes of Our weak Subjects, wicked and groundlesse Lyes of Our intention to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Estates from them by Our Commission of Array, that the said Lord Marquesse, and all such of Our good and dutifull Subjects, who had expressed a sense of their duty and Affection to Vs, being most of the eminent Gentry, and persons of greatest quality and fortune, were compelled to leave that Country, since which time, the said Lord Marquesse having brought the Forces raised by him to Vs, We have sent Our Commission under Our Great Seale of England, to the said Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> that he with the Assistance of those Persons of Honour and Quality, who have since joyned with him, and whose particular services We shall alwaies remember, and hope to reward, might raise such Forces as might subdue the Rebellion in those parts, and defend Our good Subjects there from the Force and Violence of their fellow Subjects. And We doe therefore declare to all Our loving Subjects, That what Forces soever the said Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> hath raised, or what Acts soever he hath done in pursuance of Our said Commands, and by vertue of Our said Commission, the same have been done by Our Royall Authority, and that he is so farre from being guilty of Disloyalty or Rebellion against Vs, that he and such of Our good Subjects as have assisted him have resisted and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed only Rebells, who without any Colour of Law or Right have, and doe use their utmost power to destroy Vs, to suppresse the true reformed Protestant Religion on the behalfe of Anabaptists, Brownists, and other Sectaries, to take away the Liberty and Property of Our good Subjects, and to alter the whole frame of Government so long setled, and so happily enjoyed in this Kingdome. And We doe straitly forbid and inhibite all manner of Persons to presume to yeeld any obedience to the said Order, or any way to meddle with the Estate of the said Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> to his prejudice, or to interrupt his Tenants or Officers in their quiet and peaceable enjoying the same: which if any shall presume to doe, We shall look upon them as Persons disaffected to Vs, and countenancers and fomenters of those dissentions which so neerely threaten the ruine of this Kingdom. And We farther Will and Command all Our good Subjects of Our Counties of <hi>Cornewall, Devon,</hi> and <hi>Somerset,</hi> that they be aiding and assisting to the said Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> and use their utmost power for the subduing the Rebells now in Armes against Us in those parts, under the Command of the Earle of <hi>Stamford,</hi> and for the apprehending the said Earle, and such other persons whom We have particularly excepted out of Our Proclamation of Pardon for the said severall Counties, that We may proceed against them as Traitors by the known Rules and Lawes of the Land. And We doe hereby declare, That as We shall alwaies remember the singular courage of Our County of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> and such of Our good Subjects of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Somerset,</hi> who have assisted them in their notable Zeale and Affection to Vs, the Protestant Religion, and the Liberty of the Subject, so whosoever shall assist the said Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> with Horse, Armes, Plate, or Mony, shall doe a most acceptable service unto Vs, &amp; We shall carefully pay all such summes of Mony as shall be so lent to him, And whosoever shall have the hard fortune to loose his Life in that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, We shall grant the Wardship of his Heyre to his own use without Rent or Fine, when on the contrary, the Heires of such who shall fall in the Rebellion against Us, must expect no favour from Vs. Lastly Our pleasure is, That this Our Proclamation be read in all the Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels within Our said Counties of <hi>Somerset, Devon,</hi> and <hi>Cornewall,</hi> that all Our Subjects may take notice of Our Will and Pleasure herein.</p>
